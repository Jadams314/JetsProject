# My OOP Jets Project



### Description
This application reads information about jets from a .txt file and populates an ArrayList with the information that was given. Within this application 
the user can view the jets that have been stored, add more jets to the list, remove jets from the list and call their methods
based on the type of jet that is stored(Fighter jets have their own fight method, while cargo jets have a load cargo method). 


### Topics and Technologies Used
* Abstract classes
* Inheritance
* ArrayLists
* Iterators
* File reader
* Buffered reader
* Scanner
* Try/catch w/exceptions
* While loops
* For loops
* Switches
* Getters/Setters
* non static Methods


### How to Run
Copy the class files and paste them into an IDE. Run JetApp.java

### Lessons Learned
Building on my lessons from the FoodTruck App, taking my time and planning everything out before I start writing code made this project
much easier. I gained a better understanding about how classes interact with each other through inheritance and implementation. I learned how to
take infromation from a file and build an array of object from the file.
